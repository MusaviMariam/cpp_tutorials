- default executable name "a.out" and the use of the "-o" flag to name the executable.
- name the executable using flag "-o" (store the executable objects) e.g. - "g++ practice1.cpp" to compile the code and create an executable.
- main() is the starting point of the execution process in C++
- "for" loop syntax and its application in printing numbers
- "while" loop and its condition for continuous execution
