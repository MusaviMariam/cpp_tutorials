## Introduction to C++

C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language that enables efficient low-level computation while providing high-level abstraction. This repository guides you through the key features of the language.

## Basic Syntax and Structure

Understand the basic structure of a C++ program, including how to write `main()` functions, declare variables, and include libraries.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
